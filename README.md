# BUS-390 Final Research Project  
**A Statistical Approach to Understanding Plan Size and Its Effect on HEDIS Performance in Medicare Advantage**

## 📊 Project Overview
This project explores whether Medicare Advantage (MA) plan size is associated with differences in HEDIS (Healthcare Effectiveness Data and Information Set) performance across categories of care. Using linear regression and quartile-based descriptive statistics, we analyze the relationship between plan enrollment size and quality performance across dozens of care categories.

## 📁 Dataset Files

The following files were obtained from CMS.gov’s [MA HEDIS Public Use Files](https://www.cms.gov/data-research/statistics-trends-and-reports/medicare-advantagepart-d-contract-and-enrollment-data/ma-hedis-public-use-files/ma-hedis-public-use-files-0):

- `HEDIS2024Documentation.docx` – Documentation describing HEDIS rates and categories of care.
- `MADictionary2024.xlsx` – Maps indicator keys to specific HEDIS measures.
- `HEDIS2024.xlsx` – Raw dataset with HEDIS performance data and plan metadata.
- `hedis_measures.csv` – Cleaned dataset used in the regression and descriptive statistics.
- `general.csv` – Contains plan-level metadata, including enrollment (plan size).

## 📂 R Code Files and Outputs

### Regression Analysis and Table Creation

- `RegressionResultsForIndicator.R`, `DescriptiveStatistics.R`, `NewTable1.R`  
  Used together to produce `Results - 95% CI (1).csv`, which contains regression results for each significant category of care.  
  - **Output:** Table 2 (Regression Results by Category)

### Plan Size Quartile Analysis

- `PlanSizeByQuartile.R`  
  Computes plan size distribution by quartile and generates `plan_size_by_quartile.csv`.  
  - **Output:** Table A (Plan Size by Quartile), Table 3 (Totals by Quartile)

- `RateByQuartile.R`  
  Aggregates average HEDIS rates and number of significant results by quartile into `rate_by_quartile.csv`.  
  - **Output:** Table 4 (HEDIS Rate by Quartile)

- `QuartileFiltered.R`  
  Filters and summarizes regression results to include only statistically significant findings, grouped by quartile, into `hedis_quartiles_significant.csv`.  
  - **Output:** Table 5 (Significant Results by Quartile)
